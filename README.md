# Shell Project
  This is a basic shell project that implements a command-line interface with autocorrection functionality.

## Description
   The shell allows you to enter commands and execute them. If you enter a valid command, it will be executed. If you enter an incorrect command, the shell will suggest the closest matching command and give you the option to execute it.

## Features
1. Autocorrection: The shell suggests the closest matching command when an incorrect command is entered.
2. Command Execution: Valid commands are executed as entered.  
3. Quit: You can exit the shell by entering the command "quit".
